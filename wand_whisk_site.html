    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>At <strong>Wand & Whisk Catering Co.</strong>, we believe food should nourish the soul as much as it delights the senses. Founded by Kristen and Kamora, two local women with a deep passion for cooking, our kitchen is where culinary artistry meets a touch of magic.</p>
    <p>Our dishes are inspired by our love for astrology, crystals, and the alchemy of unique spices — each plate prepared with intention, creativity, and a whole lot of love. For Kristen, this journey is deeply personal: her father, who shared a lifelong love for food and cooking, taught her the skills and heart that now guide every dish she creates. After his passing in December, she felt called to honor his memory by pursuing the dream they both cherished — building a catering business that brings people together.</p>
    <p>Whether it’s a cozy family dinner or a special occasion, we craft every menu with care, infusing each bite with flavor, warmth, and soul. Here, every gathering is a little more magical.</p>
